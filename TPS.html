  <h1>Thermal Protection System</h1>

<p>The orbiter was protected from heat during re-entry by the thermal protection system (TPS) , a thermal soaking protectivive layer around the orbiter . The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle as well as the other hottest surfaces were protected with high temperature reusable surface insulation areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in a white low temperature , reusable surface insulation , which provided protection for tempreatures below 650 Degree Celsius (1200 Fahrenheit) . The payload bay doors and parts of the upper usign surfaces were coated in reusable felt surface insulation as temperature there repaired below 370 Degree Celsius (700 Degree Fahrenheit)</p>
