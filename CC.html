  <h1>Crew compartment</h1>

<p>The Crew compartment comprised three decks , and was the pressurized habitable area on all space shuttle missions . The flight deck consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot , as well as an additional two to four seats for the crew members . The mid desk was located below the flight deck and was where the galley and crew bunks were set up as well as three or four crew member seats . The mid deck contained the airlock which could support two astronauts on an extravehicular activity (EVA) as modules . An equipment bay was below the mid deck , which stored environmental control and waste management systems .</p>
