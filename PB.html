  <h1>Payload Bay</h1>

<p>The Payload Bay comprised most of the orbiter vehicle fuselage and provided the cargo carrying space for the space shuttle's payloads . It was 18m(60 feet) long and 4.6 (15 ft) wide , and could accomodate cylindrical payloads up to 4.6(15 ft) in diameter . Payloads were secured in the payload bay by to the attachment points on the longerons . The payload bay doors served as an additional function as radiations for the orbiters vehicle's heat and were  opened upon reaching orbits for heat rejection .  </p>
