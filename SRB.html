  <h1>Solid Rocket Boosters</h1>

<p>The Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) provided 71.4% of the Space Shuttle's Thrust during lift-off and ascent and were the largest solid propellant motors ever flown . Each SRBs was 45m (149.2 feet) tall and 3.7m(12.2 feet) wide , weighed 68,000 kg and had a steel-exterior approximately 13mm (5m) thick. At the time of launch , the SRBs were armed at T 5 Minutes and could only be electrically ignited once the RS25 engines had ignited and were without issue .After Expanding their fuel , the SRBs were Jettisoned approximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately 46 km . Following Separation , they deployed drogue and main parachutes , landed in the ocean and were recovered by the Crews aboard the Ships My Free Star and MV Liberty Star . Once they were returned ,  they were cleaned and disassembled , refurbished and reused on subsequent flights .</p>
