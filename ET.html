  <h1>External Tank</h1>

<p>The Space Shuttle external tank(ET) carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main engines and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters . The ET was 47m (153.8 feet) tall and 8.4m(27.6 feet) in diameter and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) , The ET provided propellant to the space shuttle main engines fromthe lift off until main engine cutoff . The ET seperated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds often engine cutoff and could be triggered automatically or manually . At the time ET separated from orbiter vehicle , gaseous oxygen cause the ET to tumble , ensuring that it would break upon re-entry . The ET was the only major component of the space shuttle system that was not re-used and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean .</p>
